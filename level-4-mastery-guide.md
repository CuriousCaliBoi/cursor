# Level 4 Mastery: First Principles Extension Guide

## 4.1 Codebase-Level Intelligence

### Beyond File-Level Understanding

Cursor's codebase embedding allows it to understand relationships, patterns, and architecture across your entire repository.

### Architecture Queries

**Use Cursor as a Codebase Navigator**:

**Pattern Discovery**:
```
"Where is error handling centralized in this codebase?"
"Show me all places that use the repository pattern"
"What patterns are used for state management?"
"Where are API calls made? Show me the common patterns"
```

**Integration Analysis**:
```
"Show me all integration points between the payment module and order module"
"What services depend on the authentication service?"
"Trace how user data flows from API to database"
```

**Architectural Questions**:
```
"What architectural patterns are used in this codebase?"
"How is dependency injection implemented?"
"Where is configuration managed and how is it accessed?"
```

**Exercise**:
Ask Cursor 5 architectural questions about your codebase. Verify answers are accurate and useful.

### Impact Analysis

**Before Making Changes**:

**API Changes**:
```
"If I change the signature of `processPayment()` in payment.service.ts,
what files would be affected? Show me all call sites."
```

**Refactoring Impact**:
```
"I want to rename the `User` model to `Account`. What files would need
to be updated? Include imports, type references, and test files."
```

**Breaking Changes**:
```
"Would changing the authentication middleware to require a new header
break any existing API clients? Check all API routes."
```

**After Making Changes**:

**Validation**:
```
"Did my changes introduce any breaking changes? Check:
- Public API signatures
- Import statements
- Type definitions
- Database schemas"
```

**Regression Check**:
```
"Review my recent changes. Are there any places where I might have
introduced bugs? Check for:
- Null/undefined access
- Missing error handling
- Type mismatches
- Logic errors"
```

**Exercise**:
1. Before a refactor, use Cursor to analyze impact
2. Make the changes
3. Use Cursor to validate no breaking changes were introduced
4. Compare predictions with reality

### Code Discovery

**Finding Opportunities**:

**Pattern Application**:
```
"Show me all places that could benefit from the new `formatCurrency()`
utility function I just created"
```

**Duplication**:
```
"Find code duplication that should be extracted into a shared utility.
Focus on functions longer than 20 lines that appear similar."
```

**Anti-patterns**:
```
"Find instances where we're not following the repository pattern
correctly. Look for direct database access outside repositories."
```

**Technical Debt**:
```
"Identify areas of technical debt in the codebase. Look for:
- TODO comments without tickets
- Commented-out code
- Functions marked as deprecated
- Complex functions that could be simplified"
```

**Improvement Opportunities**:
```
"Find places where we could improve error handling. Look for:
- Try-catch blocks that swallow errors
- Missing error handling
- Generic error messages that could be more specific"
```

**Exercise**:
Use code discovery queries to identify and fix 3 improvement opportunities in your codebase.

## 4.2 Workflow Orchestration

### Multi-Stage Feature Development

**Orchestrating Complex Features**:

#### Stage 1: Analysis & Planning (Agent Mode)
```
Agent Mode:
"Analyze the requirements for a new user dashboard feature:

Requirements:
- Display user profile information
- Show recent activity
- Allow profile editing
- Include notification settings

Analyze:
1. What modules/components already exist that we can reuse?
2. What new components need to be created?
3. What API endpoints exist vs. need to be created?
4. What's the recommended architecture?

Output:
- List of existing components to reuse
- List of new components needed
- API requirements
- Implementation plan with file structure"
```

#### Stage 2: Core Implementation (Composer)
```
Composer (Cmd+I):
@dashboard.component.ts @dashboard.types.ts @dashboard.styles.ts

"Implement the user dashboard component based on the plan from Stage 1.
Follow our React component patterns. Use existing design system components.
Include TypeScript types for all props and state."
```

#### Stage 3: API Integration (Chat)
```
Chat:
@api.service.ts @dashboard.component.ts

"Integrate the dashboard component with the user API. Use the existing
API service patterns. Handle loading and error states. Add proper
TypeScript types for API responses."
```

#### Stage 4: Test Generation (Agent Mode)
```
Agent Mode:
@dashboard.component.ts @dashboard.test.ts @api.service.test.ts

"Generate comprehensive tests for the dashboard feature:
- Unit tests for dashboard component
- Integration tests for API calls
- Edge cases (empty data, errors, loading states)
- Accessibility tests

Follow our Jest and React Testing Library patterns."
```

#### Stage 5: Validation & Fixes (Agent Mode)
```
Agent Mode:
"Run the test suite and fix any failures. Also run linting and type
checking. Fix all issues and ensure the feature works end-to-end."
```

### Continuous Refactoring Workflow

**Weekly Improvement Cycles**:

**Week 1: Identify Technical Debt**
```
"Analyze the codebase for technical debt. Focus on:
- Code duplication
- Complex functions (>50 lines, high cyclomatic complexity)
- Missing tests
- Deprecated patterns
- Performance issues

Create a prioritized list with:
- Impact assessment
- Effort estimate
- Risk level
- Suggested approach"
```

**Week 2: Plan Refactoring Strategy**
```
"For the top 3 technical debt items from Week 1, create detailed
refactoring plans:

For each item:
- Current state analysis
- Target state design
- Step-by-step migration plan
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Testing strategy
- Rollback plan"
```

**Week 3: Execute Incrementally**
```
"Execute the refactoring plan for [item 1]. Work in small, safe increments:
- Step 1: [description] - create tests first
- Step 2: [description] - make minimal changes
- Step 3: [description] - validate and iterate

After each step, run tests and verify behavior is preserved."
```

**Week 4: Validate & Document**
```
"Review all refactoring changes from Week 3:
- Run full test suite
- Check performance impact
- Verify no regressions
- Document improvements made
- Update architecture documentation if needed"
```

### Parallel Feature Development

**Managing Multiple Features Simultaneously**:

**Option 1: Chat Tabs Within Same Branch**
**Setup**:
- Feature A: Chat Tab 1 (with relevant files @mentioned)
- Feature B: Chat Tab 2 (with relevant files @mentioned)
- Bug Fix: Chat Tab 3
- Refactoring: Background Agent

**Coordination**:
```
# Tab 1 (Feature A)
"Working on Feature A. Check if Feature B (in Tab 2) conflicts with
any changes I'm making. Review @shared.service.ts for conflicts."

# Tab 2 (Feature B)
"Working on Feature B. Verify no conflicts with Feature A. Both use
@shared.service.ts but different methods."
```

**Option 2: Git Worktrees (True Parallel Development)**
**Setup**: Separate checked-out branches
- Feature A: `git worktree add ../myapp-feature-a feature-a` → Chat Tab 1
- Feature B: `git worktree add ../myapp-feature-b feature-b` → Chat Tab 2
- Bug Fix: `git worktree add ../myapp-bugfix bugfix-123` → Chat Tab 3

**Key Advantage**: Each worktree has completely isolated context. No branch conflicts, instant switching, no stashing/unstashing.

**Advanced Pattern**: Multiple worktrees + multiple Cursor windows
```
Window 1: Auth feature worktree
  - Tab 1: Architecture planning
  - Tab 2: Implementation
  - Tab 3: Testing

Window 2: Payment feature worktree  
  - Tab 1: Code review
  - Tab 2: Bug fixes

Window 3: Hotfix worktree
  - Tab 1: Critical bug analysis
```

**For complete Git worktrees workflow**: See `GIT_WORKTREES.md`

**Exercise**:
Orchestrate a complete feature using all 5 stages. Document the time saved vs. manual implementation.

## 4.3 Extending Cursor's Capabilities

### Knowledge Packs

**Creating Domain Documentation**:

**Structure**:
```
docs/
  domains/
    auth.md          # Authentication domain overview
    payments.md      # Payment processing domain
    notifications.md # Notification system
    api.md          # API structure and conventions
```

**Knowledge Pack Template** (`docs/domains/auth.md`):
```markdown
# Authentication Domain

## Overview
[What this domain handles, its purpose]

## Architecture
[How it's structured, key components]

## Key Components
- `auth.service.ts`: Core authentication logic
- `auth.middleware.ts`: Request authentication
- `auth.types.ts`: TypeScript types
- `jwt.utils.ts`: JWT token handling

## Patterns
[Common patterns used in this domain]

## Dependencies
[What this domain depends on]

## Dependents
[What depends on this domain]

## Common Tasks
[How to do common things in this domain]

## Gotchas
[Things to watch out for]
```

**Linking from `.cursorrules`**:
```
When working on authentication:
- Refer to docs/domains/auth.md for domain context
- Follow patterns documented there
- Update documentation if patterns change
```

**Exercise**:
1. Create knowledge pack for one domain in your codebase
2. Link it from `.cursorrules`
3. Test by asking Cursor domain questions

### Change Budgeting

**Enforcing Quality Gates**:

**In `.cursorrules`**:
```
Change Budget Rules:
- Small fixes (<50 lines): Minimal review, quick merge
- Medium changes (50-200 lines): Require tests, code review
- Large changes (>200 lines): Require architecture review, comprehensive tests

For Agent Mode:
- Break large changes into smaller PRs when possible
- Each change should be independently testable
- Document why change budget was exceeded if necessary
```

**Validation Scripts**:
Create `scripts/validate-changes.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Validate change size and quality

CHANGE_SIZE=$(git diff --stat | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')
MAX_SIZE=200

if [ "$CHANGE_SIZE" -gt "$MAX_SIZE" ]; then
  echo "Warning: Change size ($CHANGE_SIZE lines) exceeds budget ($MAX_SIZE lines)"
  echo "Consider breaking into smaller changes"
  exit 1
fi

# Run other validations
make test && make lint && make typecheck
```

**Cursor Integration**:
```
Agent, before completing:
1. Check change size using `git diff --stat`
2. If >200 lines, break into smaller changes
3. Run validation script
4. Report results
```

**Exercise**:
1. Set up change budgeting in `.cursorrules`
2. Create validation script
3. Test with Agent Mode on a large change

### Regression Nets

**Comprehensive Test Coverage**:

**Critical Path Tests**:
```
Agent Mode:
"Identify the 10 most critical user flows in this application.
For each flow, create an end-to-end regression test that:
- Tests the happy path
- Tests error cases
- Tests edge cases
- Is fast and reliable

Organize tests in tests/regression/critical-flows/"
```

**Regression Test Structure**:
```
tests/
  regression/
    critical-flows/
      user-registration.test.ts
      payment-processing.test.ts
      order-fulfillment.test.ts
    api/
      auth-api.test.ts
      user-api.test.ts
    integration/
      checkout-flow.test.ts
```

**Using Agent to Generate**:
```
"For each critical flow identified, generate comprehensive regression tests.
Include:
- Setup and teardown
- Multiple scenarios (success, failure, edge cases)
- Assertions for all important states
- Performance checks if relevant
- Documentation of what's being tested"
```

**Exercise**:
1. Identify 5 critical paths in your app
2. Use Agent to generate regression tests
3. Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
4. Document coverage
