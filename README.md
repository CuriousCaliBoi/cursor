# Cursor 2.0 Mastery Roadmap

**Transform yourself into a world-class Cursor user through systematic mastery of AI-assisted development.**

This repository contains a comprehensive learning roadmap and practical resources to maximize your leverage with Cursor 2.0, extending the creators' vision of AI pair programming into mastery-level workflows.

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Roadmap**: Start with [`cursor-2-0-mastery-roadmap.plan.md`](./cursor-2-0-mastery-roadmap.plan.md)
2. **Assess Your Level**: Check the checkboxes to see where you are
3. **Follow the Guides**: Work through the level-specific guides
4. **Use the Templates**: Copy example files to your projects

## Structure

### Core Roadmap
- **`cursor-2-0-mastery-roadmap.plan.md`** - Complete roadmap with all levels and checkboxes

### Level Guides
- **`level-1-foundation-guide.md`** - Foundation: Core Competency (Week 1-2)
- **`level-2-intermediate-guide.md`** - Intermediate: Workflow Optimization (Week 3-4)
- **`level-3-advanced-guide.md`** - Advanced: Pattern Recognition & Automation (Week 5-6)
- **`level-4-mastery-guide.md`** - Mastery: First Principles Extension (Week 7-8+)

### Advanced Workflows
- **`GIT_WORKTREES.md`** - Git worktrees + Cursor Agents for parallel development

### Templates & Examples
- **`.cursorrules.example`** - Advanced `.cursorrules` template
- **`CONTEXT.example.md`** - Project context template
- **`Makefile.example`** - Standardized commands template
- **`.cursorignore.example`** - Codebase indexing configuration

### Notepad Library
- **`notepads/surgical-fix.md`** - Small, constrained fixes
- **`notepads/spec-to-code.md`** - Feature implementation from specs
- **`notepads/refactor-safe.md`** - Behavior-preserving refactors
- **`notepads/test-first.md`** - TDD workflow
- **`notepads/code-review.md`** - AI-assisted review checklist

### Original Materials
- **`thoughts.md`** - Original Cursor optimization notes (preserved for reference)

## Learning Path

### Level 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
Master the fundamentals:
- Tab autocomplete patterns
- Chat vs. Inline Edit vs. Agent Mode
- Codebase indexing
- Project configuration (`.cursorrules`, `CONTEXT.md`, commands)

**Deliverable**: Project optimized for Cursor with proper configuration

### Level 2: Intermediate (Week 3-4)
Optimize your workflow:
- Agent Mode mastery and validation loops
- Composer for multi-file editing
- Chat Tabs for parallel workflows
- Notepad library creation

**Deliverable**: Reusable prompt library and parallel workflow mastery

### Level 3: Advanced (Week 5-6)
Pattern recognition and automation:
- Custom modes (Debugging, Testing, Refactoring, Architecture)
- Memory system for personalization
- Advanced prompt engineering

**Deliverable**: Custom modes, memory system, and prompt mastery

### Level 4: Mastery (Week 7-8+)
First principles extension:
- Codebase-level intelligence queries
- Workflow orchestration
- Extending Cursor capabilities (knowledge packs, change budgeting)
- Team leverage and scaling

**Deliverable**: Extended Cursor capabilities and team-wide systems

## Philosophy

This roadmap extends Cursor 2.0's core principles:

1. **Codebase-aware intelligence**: AI that understands context at the repository level
2. **Autonomous task execution**: Agents that plan, execute, and validate
3. **Continuous learning**: Systems that remember preferences and adapt
4. **Multi-modal collaboration**: Chat, edits, autocomplete, and agents working together

The goal isn't to use every feature, but to have a deep toolkit where you instinctively choose the right tool for each task. Mastery comes from internalizing patterns until they're second nature.

## Usage

### For Individual Learning

1. Start with Level 1 Foundation Guide
2. Complete all checkboxes in the roadmap
3. Use templates to set up your projects
4. Practice each technique until it feels natural
5. Progress to next level only after mastering the current one

### For Teams

1. Team lead reviews roadmap and selects relevant levels
2. Create shared notepads in team repository
3. Set up common `.cursorrules.base` for team standards
4. Document team-specific workflows
5. Onboard new members using Level 1 materials

### For Project Setup

1. Copy `.cursorrules.example` → `.cursorrules` and customize
2. Copy `CONTEXT.example.md` → `CONTEXT.md` and fill in
3. Copy `Makefile.example` → `Makefile` and adapt to your stack
4. Copy `.cursorignore.example` → `.cursorignore` and adjust
5. Create `notepads/` directory and import templates
